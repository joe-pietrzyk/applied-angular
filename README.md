# Applied Angular Course

## This Repository

We will push this repository to Github so you will have a copy of all the work we did in class.

The `src/frontend` directory contains a pre-created Angular 18 application. We will use this as our "home base".

The `notes` directory is a good place for you to put any of your notes. 

The instructor will put their notes in the `instructor-notes` directory of their repository. You will be shown how to get a copy
of any content created by the instructor.

## Getting Started

Open an integrated terminal in this folder (`Ctrl+BackTick`), and type `just code`. This will open a *different* instance of VS Code in the `src/frontend` directory and it automatically starts the app.
